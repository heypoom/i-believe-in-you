# I believe in you.

Just breathe. You're almost there.

Inspired by [Celeste](https://store.steampowered.com/app/504230/Celeste)'s awesome greeting message, this Chrome extension will calm you down and cheer you up every time a JavaScript error has occured.

This might come in handy when you're doing heavy debugging or refactoring. :)

Remember, you can do it. I believe in you!
